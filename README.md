<b>Engine:</b> reads in the current state of the world from the world object, then calculates changes in positions of all the different shapes.</br>
<b>Runner:</b> gets the engine and world to work together. Runs about 60 times per second.</br>
<b>Render:</b> whenever the engine processes an update, Render will take a look at all the different shapes and show them on the screen.</br>
<b>Body:</b> a shape that will be displayed, can be a circle, rectangle, oval etc.</br>
